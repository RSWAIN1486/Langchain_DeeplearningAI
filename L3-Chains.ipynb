body radiation refers to the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a perfect black body, which is an object that absorbs all radiation that falls on it and emits radiation at all wavelengths. The radiation emitted by a black body depends only on its temperature and follows a specific distribution known as Planck's law. This type of radiation is important in understanding the behavior of stars, as well as in the development of technologies such as incandescent light bulbs and infrared cameras.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":45}],"source":["chain.run(\"What is black body radiation?\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"3b717379","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"id":"3b717379","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1686149780969,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":6976,"user":{"displayName":"Dvara Tech","userId":"11920201384607812533"}},"outputId":"7cfb07f8-8bbb-45a8-859c-2f4b3a8a37a3"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","\n","\u001b[1m> Entering new MultiPromptChain chain...\u001b[0m\n","math: {'input': 'what is 2 + 2'}\n","\u001b[1m> Finished chain.\u001b[0m\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'As an AI language model, I can answer this question easily.
